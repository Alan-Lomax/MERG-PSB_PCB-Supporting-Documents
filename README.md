# MERG-PSB_PCB-Supporting Documents

These are the Gerbers and Supporting Files for a MERG Article I wrote on my early experiences with PCB manufacturing.
The main purpose of the article is to describe and inspire others (especially younger MERG members) about the process of making PCBâ€™s and how inexpensive it can be.  

Due to the small component count a variety of construction techniques could have been used however in this case a small PCB was chosen
In no small part this was for me to gain familiarity with that work process.
